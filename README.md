 Project Overview
This project is built to extract and mask sensitive Named Entities (like phone numbers, emails, user IDs, and URLs) from a given text document using **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**. 

The model is **fine-tuned using Pre-trained Transformers (BERT)** to identify and mask these entities. A web app was also created using Flask to provide a user-friendly interface.

Problem Statement
The goal of this project was to:
- Detect sensitive entities such as Phone Numbers, Emails, User IDs, and URLs from text.
-  Fine-tune a Pre-trained NER Model to enhance the entity masking.
-  Build a web app to allow users to input text and mask sensitive data.

 Project Flow
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Loaded and tokenized the dataset.
2.  **Model Training:** Used Huggingface Pre-trained BERT Model for Named Entity Recognition (NER).
3.  **Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tuned the model on custom dataset to extract phone numbers, emails, user IDs, and URLs.
4.  **Web Application:** Built a web app using Flask to take text input and mask sensitive data.
5.  **Evaluation:** Evaluated the model using Classification Report and Confusion Matrix.

cd NER1_Project

 Named Entity Recognition (NER) Web Application  

This is a Flask-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) web application that identifies and masks entities like phone numbers, emails, user IDs, and URLs from input text using `spaCy`.  

Live Demo  
[Click here to access the application](https://ner1-project.onrender.com)  

Features  
- Detects and masks sensitive information (emails, phone numbers, etc.).  
- Uses `spaCy` for Named Entity Recognition (NER).  
- Simple and interactive web interface.  
- REST API support for programmatic access.  

 How to Use  
1. Open the **[Live Demo](https://ner1-project.onrender.com)** link in your browser.  
2. Enter any text containing emails, phone numbers, or other entities.  
3. Click the **Submit** button to see the masked output.  

 API Usage  
The NER model also supports API-based usage:  

**Endpoint:**  
```http
POST /ner
