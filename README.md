# 🚀 Named Entity Recognition (NER) Project - Entity Masking

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is built to extract and mask sensitive Named Entities (like phone numbers, emails, user IDs, and URLs) from a given text document using **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**. 

The model is **fine-tuned using Pre-trained Transformers (BERT)** to identify and mask these entities. A web app was also created using Flask to provide a user-friendly interface.

## ✅ Problem Statement
The goal of this project was to:
- 📜 Detect sensitive entities such as Phone Numbers, Emails, User IDs, and URLs from text.
- 🤖 Fine-tune a Pre-trained NER Model to enhance the entity masking.
- 💻 Build a web app to allow users to input text and mask sensitive data.

## ✅ Project Flow
1. 📊 **Data Preprocessing:** Loaded and tokenized the dataset.
2. 🤖 **Model Training:** Used Huggingface Pre-trained BERT Model for Named Entity Recognition (NER).
3. 🏗 **Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tuned the model on custom dataset to extract phone numbers, emails, user IDs, and URLs.
4. 💻 **Web Application:** Built a web app using Flask to take text input and mask sensitive data.
5. 📊 **Evaluation:** Evaluated the model using Classification Report and Confusion Matrix.
